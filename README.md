# terraform-vsphere-and-lab

Using terraform and packer to build a virtual information security lab on vSphere, based on the lab architecture featured in Applied Network Defense’s (AND’s) “[Building Virtual Labs](https://www.networkdefense.io/library/building-virtual-security-labs/about/)” online course.

While that course utilizes Splunk, most likely I will substitute here with HELK or Security Onion since I am more familiar and comfortable with Elastic-based approaches.

Work in progress.
